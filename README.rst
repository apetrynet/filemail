NOTE!

This is still work in progress and parts of the API might chnage as I test it further.

pyfilemail
==========

Pyfilemail is a command line tool and API for sending and recieving files with `Filemail <https://www.filemail.com>`_ based on filemail's `official API <https://www.filemail.com/apidoc/ApiDocumentation.aspx>`_
and `requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_

You should register and get an `API KEY <http://www.filemail.com/apidoc/ApiKey.aspx>`_ to unlock all features and be able to add/delete/update your transfers.
You'll be able to send files without registering, but remember to use the "--anonymous" option in the tool.

As it is now the API is a thin wrapper around filemail's REST API. Appart from :class:`pyfilemail.User` and :class:`pyfilemail.Transfer` classes, all return objects from filemail are kept as ``dict`` based on the json response.

I've tried to keep this api as simple as possible and rely on filemail's own validation of data and error codes to keep you all in check :) The reason for this is that I don't work at filemail and have no insight in what validation they have for the data passed.
It also saves me a lot of head ache writing rock solid validation code and I think this is a more flexible way of doing it. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.

So far this has been developed and tested on Ubuntu. I'll try to get my hands on a Windows and OSX machine and addapt the code to make sure it works there as well.

Any feedback is more than welcome and please report bugs through `github <https://github.com/apetrynet/pyfilemail/issues>`_
